# MachoAlfaTotal_DiscordBot
This bot is just a joke. It answers messages that start certain sentences and answers with the rest. It can also play a single Youtube video, the one from which the sentences are, in a voice channel.
That video is the following one (it's in Spanish): https://youtu.be/6peMik4tpLA
You probably aren't interested in implementing this into your server, but just in case, I must warn you that first you need to create a discord app, then copy the token and paste it on the class "MachoAlfaTotal".
Then, you can invite the app to your server via the link Discord provides you. The command /help shows an embed with all the other commands and so.
I know there are many things to improve, but this is my first programming project and I just wrote it in order to keep learning.
